	                	TriplAgent seeks to provide an alternative to the typical tourist attractions by curating lists from local experts, known as "agents" who have handpicked their favorite spots in their city. These agents are trendsetters, tastemakers, and influencers who stray far from the predictable tips given by your standard travel writers. The community of agents is constantly expanding, with several experts posting on each of the aforementioned cities. Their suggestions are the ideal guide for a different breed of traveler; those who want to avoid the crowds, long lines and lackluster experiences and get the most out of their trip.
